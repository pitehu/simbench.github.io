- `teaser.svg`: Neutral, publication-safe teaser illustration used in the homepage hero. Replace with a high-res figure when ready (keep filename to avoid code changes).

Guidelines:
- Prefer SVG for crispness; if using PNG, export 2x for retina and keep under ~300KB.
- Keep neutral colors for scores; avoid red/green implications.
- Alt text: describe the concept (datasets → groups → neutral score chips).
